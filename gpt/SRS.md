Software Requirements Specification (SRS) – xml2json
Version 1.0 – 13 Jul 2025
1 Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The xml2json utility is a standalone command-line tool written in .NET (targeting .NET 8) that converts a LabVIEW VI Package Build (.vipb) file (an XML document) into an equivalent JSON representation. Its primary purpose is to facilitate automated processing of LabVIEW package metadata within CI pipelines and to aid developers in inspecting .vipb content via JSON. This SRS follows IEEE 830-1998 standards to ensure all functional and non-functional requirements are clearly documented.
1.2 Scope
This SRS describes the observable behavior of xml2json in terms of inputs, outputs, and user interactions. It covers tool invocation, input format, JSON output, error handling, and quality attributes. The scope is limited to the functionality in the xml2json repository, not including features outside its current purpose (e.g., converting JSON back to .vipb or editing package contents). All specified functionality and behavior should be maintained consistently.
1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
.vipb – A LabVIEW VI Package Build file (XML format) containing package metadata.
CLI – Command-Line Interface.
JSON – JavaScript Object Notation, the output format of this tool.
CI/CD – Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (e.g., automated build pipelines).
.NET 8 – The version of the .NET runtime and SDK targeted by this tool.
stdout / stderr – Standard output and standard error streams.
Exit code – Integer status code returned by a process (0 = success, non-zero = failure).
RFC 8259 – The official JSON specification.

1.5 Overview
The rest of this document provides detailed specifications for xml2json. Section 2 gives an overall description (context, perspective, and constraints). Section 3 lists the functional requirements (specific behaviors). Section 4 lists the non-functional requirements. Section 5 provides a glossary.
2 Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The xml2json utility is a stand-alone CLI application typically invoked as part of an automated CI/CD process or by developers in a terminal. There is no graphical interface; interactions are via command-line arguments and text output. Key points:
It runs on the .NET 8 runtime with no LabVIEW/NI dependencies, so it can execute on any .NET 8 platform (Windows, Linux, macOS).
It reads exactly one .vipb file as input (specified by the user) and produces JSON output.
By default, the JSON is written to standard output (stdout), but the user may redirect it or specify an output file via --output.
Seed-based design: The CLI usage (--input <file>, --output <file>) and JSON formatting are inherited from the seed vipb2json tool (verified by its CI run)


.
The interface (arguments and exit codes) should remain stable across versions to avoid breaking existing workflows.
2.2 Product Functions
The primary functions of xml2json are:
Input Processing: Accept an input .vipb file (via --input flag). Validate that the file exists and is readable.
XML to JSON Conversion: Parse the .vipb (XML) and convert it into an equivalent JSON structure, including all elements and attributes.
Output Generation: Emit the resulting JSON. By default, write to stdout. If an --output <file> option is provided, write JSON exclusively to that file (no duplicate output).
Help/Usage: If the user provides -h or --help, display usage information (syntax and options) to stdout and exit with code 0.
Error Handling: On error (missing file, invalid XML, etc.), print a clear error message to stderr, produce no JSON, and exit with a non-zero status.
Exit Codes: Return exit code 0 on success and non-zero on any failure.
2.3 User Characteristics
CI Systems: Automated pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) will call the utility. They require non-interactive mode, use of standard streams for I/O, and reliable exit codes.
Developers/Build Engineers: May run the tool manually for diagnostics. They use command-line tools and JSON, but need not know .vipb internals; xml2json provides human-readable JSON. They expect concise, clear messages and documentation in English.
2.4 Constraints
Implemented in .NET 8; requires .NET 8 runtime.
One input file per invocation; no batch mode.
Input file is read-only; tool never modifies it.
Only supported output format is JSON (RFC 8259).
Offline operation; no network or external services needed.
Performance: Convert typical .vipb (≈200 KB) in under ~2 seconds.
Resource: Memory usage should remain modest (≪128 MB).
CLI interface (argument names, flags, exit codes) must remain stable for compatibility.
Tool must run headlessly (no GUI) on all .NET 8 platforms.
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
Input .vipb is assumed to be valid and generated by LabVIEW or VIPM (though xml2json will validate the XML).
Uses .NET’s built-in XML and JSON libraries (System.Xml, System.Text.Json).
Existing CI workflows (e.g., openvipbcli Action) already call this utility; xml2json should remain compatible with those workflows.
3 Functional Requirements
CLI invocation: The tool must accept an input file via --input <file.vipb> and an output file via --output <file.json>. If these flags are missing or if extra/invalid arguments are provided, the tool should print a usage error message to stderr and exit with a non-zero code (as seen in the seed tool’s CLI)


.
Default output: By default, write the JSON output to standard output (stdout) unless --output <file> is explicitly given. If --output is used, write exclusively to the file (never duplicate output).
--output <file> flag: If the user provides --output <file>, write the JSON output exclusively to that file (instead of stdout). If writing to the file fails (e.g., permission denied), print an error to stderr and exit with a non-zero code (seed’s implementation writes with File.WriteAllText and catches I/O errors)


.
File not found: If the specified input file does not exist or cannot be opened, print "Input file not found" to stderr, exit with a non-zero code, and do not produce any JSON. (Seed’s vipb2json checks File.Exists and reports the missing file)

.
Invalid XML: If the input file exists but contains malformed XML (or is not valid .vipb), print "Invalid VIPB format" to stderr, exit with a non-zero code, and do not produce any JSON. (Seed’s tool catches XML parsing exceptions and prints an error message)

.
Runtime errors: Catch any other runtime exceptions (I/O errors, out-of-memory, etc.). If such an error occurs, print a clear error message to stderr, exit with a non-zero code, and ensure no JSON is produced. The tool must not crash or emit a stack trace to stdout (seed’s implementation follows this practice)

.
Help flag: If the user includes -h or --help in the arguments, display usage instructions (syntax and options) to stdout and exit with code 0. (For example, seed’s vipb2json echoes usage info and exits 0)

.
4 Non-Functional Requirements
Correctness: JSON must fully represent the input .vipb content. For the same input and version, output JSON must be byte-for-byte identical on each run.
Usability: CLI should use familiar conventions (single-dash for short flags, double-dash for long flags). Messages and documentation must be clear and English.
Reliability: Tool must handle errors as specified; it should never hang or leave partial output.
Performance: Typical conversions should be fast (on the order of seconds for moderate file sizes) with minimal resources.
Portability: Tool must run unchanged on all .NET 8-supported OSes (Windows, Linux, macOS) in a command-line environment.
Maintainability: Code should be modular (separate modules for CLI parsing, conversion, I/O). Repository should include documentation and tests. Only open-source libraries may be used.
