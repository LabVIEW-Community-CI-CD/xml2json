The SRS mentions publishing the VS Code extension to the Marketplace by T+25 days. However, SRS ยง7.2 NFR-E-2 requires that the extension be side-loaded and not publicly published. Update the deliverables section to:

- Remove any reference to Marketplace publication as a required deliverable.
- State that the extension (.vsix) will be packaged and distributed via the internal artifact feed instead of the public Marketplace.
