The Software Requirements Specification document should be available in multiple formats. Convert or reformat the SRS into:

- **PDF:** A print-friendly PDF version for distribution.
- **Rich Text or RST:** (if applicable) for alternative documentation systems.
- Ensure the formatting is clear and preserves the table of contents, headings, and tables.
- Check that all links and references (e.g., to raw.githubusercontent.com) are updated to valid URLs.
