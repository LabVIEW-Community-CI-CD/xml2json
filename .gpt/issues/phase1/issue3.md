Provide command-line examples demonstrating how to use VipbJsonTool in common scenarios. This should include:

- Example commands for each mode (`vipb2json`, `json2vipb`, `patch2vipb`), showing typical usage with input and output file arguments.
- Examples of using the patch functionality (e.g., applying a YAML patch file with `patch2vipb`).
- Scenarios that include the optional parameters `alwaysPatch`, `branchName`, and `autoPr`.
- Explanation of expected behavior and output for each example.
- These examples should be added to the README or a dedicated `docs/usage.md` file.
