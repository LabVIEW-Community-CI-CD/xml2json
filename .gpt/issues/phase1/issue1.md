The tool needs comprehensive developer documentation to explain its usage and design. This should include:

- **Overview and Purpose:** A high-level description of VipbJsonTool and its role in the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Usage Guide:** Instructions for building and running the tool, including command-line examples for `vipb2json`, `json2vipb`, and `patch2vipb` modes.
- **Architecture and Design:** Explanation of the code structure and key components (e.g., JsonToXmlConverter, PatchApplier).
- **Configuration and Dependencies:** Details on required .NET runtime, libraries, and how environment variables (e.g., `GITHUB_TOKEN`) are used.
- **Examples:** Example workflows showing how to apply patches and automate commits, with sample input and output.
